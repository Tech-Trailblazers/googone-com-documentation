# 🌐 GooGone SDS / MSDS Documentation

> “Transparency in chemicals. Safety in knowledge.”

This repository is a community-driven collection of **Safety Data Sheets (SDS / MSDS)** and related safety documentation for **GooGone** products. Our goal is to make chemical safety information open, structured, and useful — for families, educators, researchers, first responders, and innovators.

## 📋 What Are SDS / MSDS?

SDS (Safety Data Sheet) and MSDS (older term, Material Safety Data Sheet) are standardized documents that manufacturers provide to disclose:

- 🧪 Ingredients and chemical composition
- ⚠️ Hazards, warnings, and classification
- 🚑 First aid & emergency instructions
- 🔥 Firefighting & reactivity measures
- 🧯 Safe handling, storage, and use
- ♻️ Spill response, disposal, and cleanup procedures

They serve as the authoritative source of how to handle, respond to, and manage chemical risks.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Even though safety information is often published, it tends to suffer from:

- Being scattered across many pages or PDFs
- Being difficult to search or compare between products
- Being unavailable in machine-readable or structured form

This repo aims to:

- **Gather & centralize** all available GooGone SDS / MSDS
- **Convert & structure** them for easier use (JSON, YAML, CSV, etc.)
- **Open access** to empower learning, safety, AI, and community resilience
- **Support public health & safety** by making chemical information more accessible

In short: this is more than just a collection — it’s a **tool for safety, education, and empowerment**.

## 🔍 How to Use the Data

1. **Browse or download** SDS / MSDS files (PDFs and structured formats)
2. **Parse & extract** sections you need: hazards, composition, first aid, etc.
3. **Build tools & applications**:
   - Safety lookup chatbots
   - Educational dashboards
   - Emergency reference assistants
4. **Cross-check & verify** with official, up-to-date manufacturer SDS versions
5. **Use responsibly** — in emergencies, contact medical professionals, poison control, etc.

## 🗂 Data Format & Organization

We aim for balance: preserving original documents + enabling machine usability.

- 📄 **Original PDFs / Documents**: the raw SDS / MSDS files
- 📆 **Versioning / History**: if multiple versions exist, they are retained with timestamp or version tag

This approach allows human users to inspect original content while giving developers structured data to work with.

## 📜 License & Permissions

This project is licensed under the **MIT License**.
You are free to use, share, adapt, and redistribute the content — even for commercial purposes — so long as you keep the original attribution and license.

Open safety knowledge should stay open.

## ⚠️ Safety Disclaimer

**Important:**

- This repository is for **educational, informational, and preparatory** use only.
- It is **not a medical, legal, or professional substitute**.
- In case of chemical exposure, poisoning, or emergency:
  1. Call your local **Poison Control Center** or **Emergency Services**
  2. Consult the _official SDS_ specific to your product, version, and region
  3. Seek professional medical / toxicological assistance

Consider this data as guidance — not a replacement for expert support.

## 🌍 A Vision for Safer Communities

Chemicals are in everyday life — cleaners, sprays, solutions — but knowing **what’s inside matters**.

By participating in this project, you help:

- Equip families with safer, clearer information
- Support education with real-world materials
- Empower first responders in critical moments
- Extend chemical safety knowledge to communities that lack access

Let’s build a future where **transparency in chemicals = safety for all** — one SDS at a time.

Thank you for exploring, contributing, caring.
